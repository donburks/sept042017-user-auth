# Authentication Example

This example requires a PostgreSQL server up and running.

1. Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and add your configuration.
2. Run the included Knex migrations with `knex migrate:latest`
3. Start the app with `npm start`
4. You can also use nodemon with `npm run local`

This code was adapted from an [original example by David Van Dusen](https://github.com/davidvandusen/06mar2017-auth), and further work by Fabio Neves, and then customized by Don Burks.
